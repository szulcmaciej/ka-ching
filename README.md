# Ka-ching!
A simple web app for measuring the time spent working.

Check it here: [http://czasoumilacz.herokuapp.com/](http://czasoumilacz.herokuapp.com/)

It uses local storage for saving the state, so you can press play, close the app and return any time you want :)

Don't be surprised by the sound effects :) After working each full hour, a ka-ching sound effect is played (the key feature ðŸ˜‚). After 8 hours of work, the app will let you know it's enough for the day by ringing a bell.
